# **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

## 🎮 **About the Project**
The **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** is a simple Python-based project where players can compete against the computer. The game follows the classic rules:
- **Rock beats Scissors**
- **Scissors beats Paper**
- **Paper beats Rock**

This project is an excellent way to practice Python programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, and randomization.
